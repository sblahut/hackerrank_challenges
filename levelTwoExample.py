#####   For example, given the list l as [“1.1.2”, “1.0”, “1.3.3”, “1.0.12”, “1.0.2”], 
#####   the function solution(l) would return the list [“1.0”, “1.0.2”, “1.0.12”, “1.1.2”, “1.3.3”]. 
#####   If two or more versions are equivalent but one version contains more numbers than the others, 
#####   then these versions must be sorted ascending based on
#####   how many numbers they have, e.g [“1”, “1.0”, “1.0.0”]. The number of elements in the 
#####   list l will be at least 1 and will not exceed 100.
